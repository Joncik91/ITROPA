## What is ITROPA?

ITROPA helps you discover innovative opportunities by:

1. **Exploring Human Needs** - Start with fundamental needs like Belonging, Status, Mastery
2. **Researching Prior Art** - See how needs have been met historically and across domains
3. **Generating Future Predictions** - AI predicts future industries addressing these needs
4. **Extracting Mechanisms** - Understand WHY solutions work at an abstract level
5. **Cross-Pollinating Ideas** - Combine mechanisms from different domains for breakthrough innovations

### Core Philosophy

> **Innovation = Prior Art + New Context**

Most innovations aren't created from scratch—they're recombinations of existing solutions applied in new ways. ITROPA makes this process systematic and AI-powered.

## About ITROPA

ITROPA was created to make innovation more systematic and accessible. By combining AI capabilities with proven innovation methodologies like prior art research and cross-domain transfer, ITROPA helps individuals and teams discover breakthrough opportunities.

The tool is built on the principle that most innovations are recombinations—taking what works in one context and applying it in another. ITROPA makes this process faster, more comprehensive, and AI-enhanced.

**Built with:**
Modern web technologies, powerful AI, and a commitment to user privacy and data ownership.

**Philosophy:**
Innovation through research, not just brainstorming. Systematic exploration, not random ideation. Recombination of the proven, not invention from scratch.
